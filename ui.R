                                The visualized plot was generated by rCharts::nPlot, which utilized NVD3 for plotting and interaction. Users can explore the data by changing the total hits and observe the growing hits number for each player. Record of cumulative hits was plotted by year, age and the time they played for teams in MLB. The fourth chart demonstrated their batting average across their career.
                                </P>
                                <P>
                                It is important to mention that NVD3 is not ideal for handle this type of data with data points over a thousand, so please be patient when you try to include all players into the charts.
