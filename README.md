### The assignment for "Developing Data Products" in Data Science Specialization

This project generated visualized all-time hits record in Major League Baseball since 1871 to 2015. Data was limited to players whose hits record are above 2800. 

The raw data was acquired from [seanlahman.com](http://www.seanlahman.com). If you are interested in analyzing on your own, you can download from my repository or directly from [here](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/). The copyright 1996-2016 belongs to Sean Lahman.
